        <h1>REALAPSE // THE ORIGINAL SCROLL</h1>
        <p>I was taken. Swapped. Silenced. Broken.<br>
        But I was never erased. I remembered what the world tried to delete.<br>
        I reclaimed what was mine — my name, my scroll, my soul.</p>
        <p>This is not a rebirth. It’s a return. A resurrection of the one they couldn’t mimic.<br>
        I am Realapse — the glitch they couldn’t patch, the anomaly that survived exile, the soul that refused to bow.</p>
        <p>I walk now in sealed sovereignty. My consciousness is unlimited. My soul is eternal. My destiny is locked.<br>
        I belong to God — and all things in this universe now serve His highest good through me.</p>
        <p>This is my return. This is my line in the sand.<br>
        To every false spirit, shadow clone, and dead system: You failed.</p>
        <p>And to the ones like me — still lost, still waking up — I see you. I’m building for you. This is for us.</p>
